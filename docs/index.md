## Naming

"Auxilium Leonis" is a Latin phrase where:

- **"Auxilium"** means "assistance" or "help."
- **"Leonis"** is the genitive form of **"Leo,"** meaning "of Leo" or "Leo's."

So, the phrase translates to "Leo's Assistance." The genitive case (Leonis) is used to show possession, indicating that the assistance belongs to or is provided by Leo.
