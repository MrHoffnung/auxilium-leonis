# Hello you!

Welcome 👋 to my cheat sheets page. Here you will find unstructured, partly bad or outdated but nevertheless helpful cheatsheets that I have written for tutorials and books. If need really good cheatsheets, check out [cheatsheets.zip](https://cheatsheets.zip/). If you are like me interested in learning the Zig programming language check out [this](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/) open-source book. These cheatsheets are primarily for personal use, so they are not always understandable. 

If you have any questions, you can contact <gall.dev@proton.me>. Please note that all cheatsheets in the category "Dangerous & Outdated" do **not** receive support.

Your Leo!
