# Hello you!

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to my cheat sheets page. Here you will find unstructured, partly bad or outdated but nevertheless helpful cheatsheets that I have written for tutorials and books. These cheatsheets are primarily for personal use, so they are not always understandable. If you have any questions, you can contact <gall.dev@proton.me>. Please note that all cheatsheets in the category "Dangerous & Outdated" do **not** receive support.

Your Leo!
