# Machine Learning - kurz & gut

"Machine Learning - kurz & gut" is a small book (287 pages) that tries to explain difficult machine learning topics as simply as possible. It was written by [Oliver Zeigermann](https://zeigermann.eu/) and [Chi Nhan Nguyen](https://entwickler.de/experten/chi-nhan-nguyen). I recently bought the book in a bookstore and am writing a cheat sheet for each chapter to draw a conclusion and remember it better. You can buy the book [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning/9781492067467/). You may be wondering why these cheat sheets start with Chapter 2: the reason is simply that the first chapter wasn't difficult enough.
